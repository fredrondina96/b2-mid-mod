# Story 3
# As a user,
# When I go to a mechanics show page
# I see their name, years of experience, and names of all rides they’re working on
# And I also see a form to add a ride to their workload
# When I fill in that field with an id of an existing ride and hit submit
# I’m taken back to that mechanics show page
# And I see the name of that newly added ride on this mechanics show page
